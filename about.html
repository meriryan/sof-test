                    I'm Sofia Pate, a photographer and creative based in Michigan. I'm currently studying Creative Advertising at Michigan State University with a minor in Media Photography, where I explore how storytelling, strategy, and visual design intersect to create meaningful impact.
                <br><br>As the Photo Director for VIM Magazine, MSU's student-run fashion and lifestyle publication, I lead the creative vision for all editorial photography. I oversee photoshoots from concept to final image and collaborate with stylists, writers, and creative teams to build cohesive visual narratives that define VIM's artistic identity.
                <br><br>Beyond VIM, I've been a freelance photographer since 2019, capturing everything from intimate weddings and portraits to conceptual and documentary-style projects. My approach is rooted in storytelling - I aim to photograph people as they are, in moments that feel unfiltered yet intentional.
